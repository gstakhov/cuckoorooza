Cuckoorooza ("kukuruza") is how you say the word corn in Russian.  It's one of my favorite sounds and the portmanteau effect of prefixing it with the English euphemism for crazy/nutty/kooky is simply delightful.  So there's that.

****************

Our perspectives are a function of our unique life experiences, and mine is heavily influenced by my background in document/records and information management. Unsurprisingly, I find myself focused on distributed storage and the amazing breakthroughs systems like IPFS and Filecoin have made in the space. But I also feel like there is currently an imbalance in the distributed storage ecosystem, characterized by a heavily slanted focus on storage scalability and persistence; and a corresponding void around data hygiene (e.g., lifecycle, retention and disposition).

All things naturally conform to a lifecycle. It's just the way our world works. Trees shed; catterpillars metamorphose; eventually all plants and animals die and new ones are born to take their place. Even the Universe itself is in a constant state of flux, somewhere on its own axis of existence - its own lifecycle. There is a natural balance, or hygiene if you will, to the very concept of *lifecycle* that simply resonates with the operational underpinnings of our world. 

Data and information is no different. It too comes into existence and follows a course charted by its unique utility/relevance pattern. There are times when a document, or its metadata (or both), will be more relevant and more valuable than at other times in its life. Eventually it will cease to be relevant or have any value altogether. Nobody needs the scanned image of my driver's license from 20 years ago.

Even if the hubris-heavy idea of anything we create being truly *permanent* is a laughable fallacy in the grand scheme of things, content and data that is bound by a contract of persistence and immutability but unchecked by a lifecycle-driven counterbalance runs the risk of eventually imploding under its own weight.

Eventually it would be great if users of this dApp would be able to hook into the various functions that generate metadata on their behalf (thinking about the social media context here), so that they could control how it is stored, and could conceivably charge for access.  Imagine, rather than Facebook and Google controlling your data and deciding who they get to sell it to and how, *you* are the sole custodian of *your* information, and *you* get to decide who has access to what, and at what price.  I guess such a business model would force the current Facebooks and Googles to drastically alter their own business models to survive in that type of world.  And why not?
